Project Introduction:

Final project for CS128H section, implement an app helping people see a doctor in home and check their health condition. 

Goals and objectives: design good UI, implement a chat platform (at least), and if I have more time, inbed an AI chat box in it.
WHY: to help people become healthier and know what is happening to their body anytime without going to a specific hospital. I think the significant utility is in the mental side, people may feel a master of their body so they will not worry all the time.
