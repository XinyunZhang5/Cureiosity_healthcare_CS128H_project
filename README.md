Project Introduction:

Final project for CS128H section, implement an app helping people see a doctor in home and check their health condition. 

Goals and objectives: design good UI, implement a chat platform (at least), and if I have more time, inbed an AI chat box in it.
WHY: to help people become healthier and know what is happening to their body anytime without going to a specific hospital. I think the significant utility is in the mental side, people may feel a master of their body so they will not worry all the time.


Technical Overview:

Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of ‘roadmap’ for tasks you need to complete for your project to be functional.
Please list what you plan to have finished by each checkpoint. These are meant to be goals to keep your project on track. We will NOT grade your checkpoints on how much you have completed, but on whether or not you’ve made some progress. 
1; a login page, a home page, a profile page, a chatbox page.
2:Checkpoint1: complete the design and login and home page .
  Checkpoint2: complete the profile page and chatbox page(without utility).
  Checkpoint3: complete all utility.

    Using Rust for the first time in a project, which may need to learn lots of things and new tools.
